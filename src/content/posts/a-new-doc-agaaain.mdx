title: A new doc agaaain
---

When a new doc is created, a draft seems to be left behind.

Actually, it didn't do it that time... maybe upon update?

Didn't happen that time either... hmmm... perhaps an annoying race condition?

I'm not sure when it happens... or if it even does happen anymore... seems like there is some situation where I can generate the "Document not found" error from ProseMirror though
